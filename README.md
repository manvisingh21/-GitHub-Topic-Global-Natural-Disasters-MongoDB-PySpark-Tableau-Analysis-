Project Overview: This repository integrates MongoDB, PySpark, and Tableau for a comprehensive data analysis and visualization endeavor. The project focuses on the examination of natural disaster behaviors, aiming to derive spatial insights into regions with notable event occurrences. The dataset, sourced from 1965 to 2016, comprises 23,412 meticulously documented records of telluric phenomena. These records, originating from the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), contribute to the profound understanding of seismic events and their impacts.

Technical Implementation: Utilizing MongoDB as the database, PySpark serves to construct Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes. These processes form the foundation for data preparation, ensuring compatibility with subsequent analytical steps. The data is then visualized through Tableau, employing an array of charts, graphs, and maps for nuanced representation.

Key Insights:Through processed data, distinct patterns emerge, particularly evident in the "Ring of Fire" region. Investors operating in these areas are advised to consider supply chain intricacies, as heightened asset prices and more stringent insurance policies underscore the necessity for a meticulous risk classification.

Significance and GitHub Usage: This project is designed to be a valuable resource for stakeholders seeking informed decisions in risk management and investment. The concise integration of MongoDB, PySpark, and Tableau reflects a strategic and comprehensive approach to data analysis, making this repository an essential asset for those engaged in the world of big data and analytics.
