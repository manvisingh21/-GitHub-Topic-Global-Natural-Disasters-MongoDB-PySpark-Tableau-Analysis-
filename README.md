Global-Natural-Disasters-MongoDB-PySpark-Tableau-Analysis

Overview:
This project combines MongoDB for data storage, PySpark for ETL processes, and Tableau for data visualization. The dataset, sourced from the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), spans from 1965 to 2016, encompassing 23,412 records of various seismic phenomena. The focus is on understanding the spatial distribution of natural disasters, particularly in the "Ring of Fire" region.

Key Objectives:
1. Data Analysis: Investigate patterns and behaviors of natural disasters over time.
2. Spatial Understanding: Use geographic data to visualize and analyze areas with a high frequency of events.
3. Risk Assessment: Assess risk in identified regions and explore its implications for supply chain and asset management.
4. Data Visualization: Leverage Tableau's capabilities to create compelling visualizations, including charts, graphs, and maps.
5. Insights for Investors: Provide insights for investors considering the impact of natural disasters on supply chain and asset prices.

Significance
This project offers a comprehensive exploration of natural disaster data, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding risk management and investment strategies. The focus on the "Ring of Fire" allows for a specific and targeted analysis of a region prone to seismic events. The combination of MongoDB, PySpark, and Tableau showcases a holistic approach to data analysis and visualization.
